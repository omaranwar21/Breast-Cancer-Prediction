## Information
- The project Front-end is made using HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap. <br>
- The project Back-end is made using Flask (Python) and Machine Learning using python. <br>
> General Information
- This project is to predict whether the patient breast tumor is malignant or benign upon certain dimensions of the tumor nuclei.
- The ML model has an accuracy up to 97%.
- We reduced the features from 29 feature to only 4 features to make good user experience.
- Although we reduced the features up to 86.2%, this did not make the model to under-fit and maintained high accuracy.
- The Feature Selection is made by two ways as a test of our understanding:
  - Automatic Feature Selection using certain modules.
  - Manual Feature Selection using a function which we made, based on correlation.
